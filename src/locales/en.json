  "landingpage.projekt.header": "What is Project E-Mobility?",
  "landingpage.projekt.text": "Project E-Mobility is an interdisciplinary project involving the Department of Computer Science (Fachbereich 4) and the Department of Vehicle Technology (Fachbereich 2). The goal is to collect vehicle data from electric cars through the available OBD connector for subsequent analysis. Special emphasis is placed on the analysis of battery recuperation and other technical elements.",
  "landingpage.goals.header": "What Are We Trying to Achieve?",
  "landingpage.goals.text": "As mentioned above, the project aims to collect data and create a basis for understanding battery recuperation in electric vehicles. The long-term goal is to develop a system that is easy to use and cost-effective to produce. This would allow sending the device to different individuals/institutions to collect data, leading to more data and a better starting point for further research.",
  "landingpage.collaboration.header": "Who Can Participate in the Project?",
  "landingpage.collaboration.text": "The project is primarily aimed at students of HTW Berlin. However, as an open-source project, it is also open to external individuals to submit proposals and pull requests for the project. Furthermore, you can interact with active students and other contributors in the project's Discord channel.",
